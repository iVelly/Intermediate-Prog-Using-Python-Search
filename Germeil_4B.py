# Prompt: Write a program that will determine the change a user will receive based on the total cost of all items 
#purchased. The user should be able to enter as many items as they want. When a user enters an itemâ€™s 
#cost, ask them if this item will be taxed. If the item will be taxed, calculate the taxable amount. When the 
#user has finished entering all of their items the program should display: the total number of items 
#purchased, the total cost of all items, the total taxable amount of taxed items, and the final total due (cost
#+ tax). Once all of the values are printed, prompt the user for amount tendered. Re-print out the final total 
#cost of all items, the amount tendered, and the change the user will receive. All monetary values must be 
#formatted to 2 decimal places.

# VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
# itemPrice = Price of item
# letsGo = " Do you want to add more items?" is the user will be prompted to answer
# total = Sum of all the items
# tenderedCash = " How much money will you give the clerk?"
# changeRecieved = How much change the customer recieves
# isItemTaxable = is the item taxable
# subTotal = subtotal
# totalSalesTax = all the sales tax combined
# salesTax = the itemPrice times .07
